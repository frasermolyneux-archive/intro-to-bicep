# [<](./../../README.md) Using a remote module

This scenario shows how to use a remote module that has been published to an Azure Container Registry. This requires the [local-module](./../local-module/local-module.md) and [publish-remote-module](./../publish-remote-module/publish-remote-module.md) demos to have been completed.

The `bicepconfig.json` will need to be updated with the name of the ACR for this demo to work.
